<h2 id="part2">Who Was Edward Jenner</h2>
<p>Edward Jenner was an English physician and scientist who lived from 1749-1823. He invented the very first vaccination when he discovered that milkmaids who caught cowpox were less prone to catching the dangerous disease, smallpox. Edaward Jenner is often called "The Father of Immunology", and his work is said to have "saved more lives than the work of any other human". Because of Edward Jenner's work, in 1979, smallpox became known as an eradicated disease, meaning it no longer existed.</p> 
<h2 id="part1">How Vaccination Has Impacted Our Lives Today</h2>
<p>Vaccination has saved the lives of many. Smallpox would still be in existance (probably) if it were not for Edward Jenner. The world might be perishing much more than it is today. A report from the World Health Organization states that today vaccines prevent 2.5 million deaths per year: Every minute five lives are saved by vaccines worldwide.</p>
<h2 id="part4">What Vaccination Does</h2>
<p>The purpose of vaccination is to produce immunity. Immunity means the presence in a person's body of cells and substances known as antibodies that can produce a protective immune response. A vaccine is a way to build your body's natural immunity to a disease before you get sick. This keeps you from getting and spreading the disease. For most vaccines, a weakened form of the disease germ is injected into your body. Refer to the second video for more about this.
