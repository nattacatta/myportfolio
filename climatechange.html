     <h1>Earth's Natural Enemy.<br> Climate Change.</h1>
     <p>  You've probably heard of climate change. You probably know what it does and how dangerous it is, but do you do anything about it? Because, if climate change can destroy the world and cause people like you and me to suffer, why isn't the world doing anything to stop it before it rids us? </p>
     <p>Few people in the world care to make an impact on reducing climate change, a good example being Greta Thunberg, a Swedish activist. She realised how climate change would affect her generation and did all that she could to encourage others to join her in...Saving the world, basically.</p>
          <h2>Earth's Giant Game of Tetris</h2>
     <p>Earth is suffering, but it's just too hard to explain everything, so here's a video that puts climate change simply. As a game of tetris!</p>

  <h2>Climate Change to Animals</h2>
     <div class="section-left">

       <p>Polar bears are examples of badly affected animals. Due to global warming, their land has been melting slowly away. Almost any animal, in fact, living in cold climates are in urgent need of readapting to the "new world" coming their way. If they don't act quickly, their kind might become extinct. Animals can adapt, but sometimes, they can't do it fast enough.

       <p>Scientists estimate that 150-200 species of plant, insect, bird and mammal become extinct every 24 hours. This is nearly 1,000 times the “natural” or “background” rate and, say many biologists, is greater than anything the world has experienced since the vanishing of the dinosaurs nearly 65m years ago. This is really scary, because if so many species are going extinct because of (possibly) human activities, how long would it take for pandas, polar bears, tigers, rhinos and turtles to disappear? If we don't act soon, it is estimated that more than 1 million animals would be extinct by 2050. 2050 might seem far away, but it's actually less than 30 years away. It's much scarier when I put it that way, so why not we make a move, and take a step forward?</p>

     <h2>Presenting to you...Greta Thunberg</h2>
     <p>I mentioned Greta Thunberg earlier on in this article, but she is so awesome that I must mention her again. She's 17 year old (this is the year of 2020), yet she shows the world that young people can make a difference. She shares her thoughts on climate change to the world and has gained respect from world leaders. She has won awards such as The Shorty Awards For Best In Activism, The Right Livelihood Award, The Ambassador Of Conscience Award and many more. So, I've prepared a couple of videos on her here!</p>

     <p>Let's start with turning off the air conditioner or having a "Meatless Monday". Let's reuse, reduce and recycle. Bring a reusable bag when you go out to shop, don't throw away the cardboard from toilet rolls, reuse them to make something useful for yourself! Don't get a new pencil case if you've used your old one for only a year and if it's still in good shape. To go even further, we can do things like eating less meat-or no meat! We can stop buying so many new and unneccesary items like clothes, which play a big role in climate change. Remember, every step counts. Apart from playing our own part in climate change, we should encourage others to do so too. The more the merrier when it comes to saving the world! You can do your part!<br></p>
