 <h2 id="part2">What Is Gunpowder?</h2>
<p>Gunpowder is the earliest known chemical explosive. <br> It was discovered by Chinese chemists who were on the hunt for immortality. Gunpowder is not only used in wartime, but also in celebration. Gunpowder is used in making fireworks. Once a firework is in the sky, gunpowder is what causes it to BOOM and SPARKLE! It consists of a mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate. The sulfur and charcoal act as fuels while the saltpeter is an oxidizer</p>
 <h2 id="part3">How Gunpowder Has Impacted Our Lives Today</h2>
