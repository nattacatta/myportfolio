 <h2 id="part1">The Name</h2>
 <p>The name "Nattiepedia" isn't just random, it has got some logic behind it. "Nattie" comes from my name, Natalie. it's my preferred nickname and can be also spelt as "Natty", "Natee" and "Nattee". However, I chose "Nattie" because it definitely looks the cutest in text! Apart from that, my second favourite spelling of "nattie" is "natty" which is actually already a word.  The word "natty" is an adjective that comes from the 18th century. Originally it was a slang term, perhaps related to the adjective neat. These days, if you say someone “looks neat,” it might sound like they look clean, but it also can mean that they look fashionable and put together. Sweet but irrelevant. It may give people the wrong idea on what Nattiepedia truly is. So,I also chose "nattie" to avoid confusion. Now you might be also wondering where I got "pedia" from. If you haven't already guessed it yet, Nattiepedia is almost a mini version of Wikipedia. "Pedia" means "Related to learning", and it is true that nattiepedia is related to learning with all it's fun facts. And the name "Nattiepedia" definitely has a nice ring to it, huh?</p>
 <h2 id="part2">The Creator</h2>
<p>At the age of 11, a girl called Natalie came up with "Nattiepedia" when she joined a coding class which required her to do so. Since then, she has been working tirelessly to create pages using HTML and CSS (coding languages) to the best of her abilities. She currently studies at a school in Singapore, but likes to think that she is smart enough to not have to go to school even though she has made close friends there. She has a younger sister called Naomi (who is adorable!) and has a loving, kind and caring mother and father. She celebrates her birthday on the 29th of January every year, but her favourite celebration is actually Christmas. During the Covid-19 pandemic, she perservered through quarantine (she actually really enjoyed quarantine. No school!) and won a competition organised by Straits Times, the local newspaper. She was born in Edinburgh and at the age of 6, she moved to Singapore with her family for education :(, family :) and work (she does not work yet, referring to father). She excels in her studies and is a prefect. Her family YouTube channel is very successful and she takes great interest in Musical Theatre. She loves to read, her favourite books being Harry Potter (the entire series), The Penderwicks and Anne Of Green Gables. She loves chocolate and Pizza Express and will eat half a steamed chicked if desired. She has a good voice (says most people) and has a unicycle which she cannot ride well yet, can juggle and spin plates on a stick. Once she learns the unicycle, she should join the circus! She can play the ukulele, the piano, sing and has basic recorder, harmonica and cajon skills. Maybe she should start a band...Her Chinese tuitor wouldn't be too happy about any of those careers. To her, Natalie can only be a doctor-scientist. </p>

<h2 id="part3">More On The YouTube Channel</h2>
 <p>Now what about the YouTube channel. People these days are crazy about YouTube, so I decided to put it in just for fun. Everychusday is a kid-friendly channel where I aka Natalie aka "Miss Chu" and my Little Sis make ukulele tutorials, try art experiments, and other random amazing stuff. When we first started our channel to connect with friends overseas a few years ago, we would have never imagined having the experience to be on the news, reaching way over 1000 subscribers, being offered the chance to perform at shows and for our channel to even be discovered by teachers and classmates in school which led to us making videos or them and more! I never imagined that we would one day, with our experience in film, win competitions (and money)! If your iterested, here are some of my favourite videos:</p>
